                    <h3>Brazil</h3>
                    <p>Brazil is the largest and easternmost country in South America and in Latin America. It is
                        the
                        world's
                        fifth-largest country by area and the seventh most populous.</p>
                    <p>The country is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a
                        century of
                        mass
                        immigration from around the world. It is considered to have the greatest biodiversity of any
                        country
                        on the planet, containing over
                        70%
                        of all animal and plant species catalogued.</p>
