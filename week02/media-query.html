            <h2>Mosiah 3:19</h2>
            <p>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and
                ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and
                becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek,
                humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon
                him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</p>

            <h2>Mosiah 4:27</h2>
            <p>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run
                faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he
                might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</p>
